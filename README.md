# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to apply an ARIMA model to predict stock prices using historical data. It focuses on the stock prices of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** and walks through the process of cleaning the data, selecting model parameters, evaluating performance, and discussing possible improvements.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Some ideas for future development include:
- Using Bayesian optimization for parameter selection
- Incorporating external factors (e.g., financial indicators)
- Comparing ARIMA with models like LSTM or Prophet
- Running the model on longer forecasting windows
- Using cloud services to overcome computational limitations
